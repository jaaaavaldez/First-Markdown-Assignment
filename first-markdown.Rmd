# Why Analyze Data

#### Tina
#### Aze
#### Manu
#### Justin  
> world nowadays boasts an abundance of information that not only continuously grows, but is also easy to access. The challenge then comes in the form of filtering and processing all this information into relevant and valuable  statistics in which various inferences can be made from. This process of handling data is an invaluable procedure in interpreting what information is already available.
